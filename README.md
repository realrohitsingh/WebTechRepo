# WebTechRepo

This repository contains my practice projects for learning and improving web development skills. Each folder is a separate project or small exercise using HTML and CSS (and sometimes JavaScript). These projects are simple, hands-on, and for personal learning.

## Project Folders
- **BookMyShow clone** – Simple clone of the BookMyShow website
- **RedBus Clone** – Basic replica of the RedBus site
- **Proj 1** – Individual practice project
- **Day 6 - Task to create a restro menu** – Exercise to create a restaurant menu

- **day 7 - Practice** – General practice folder
- **day 8 task to create a movie preview** – Task to make a movie preview page
- **day 9 task to create resume** – Task to build a simple resume page

## How to Use
You can open each folder and run the HTML files directly in your browser to see the output. These are for beginner learning and experimentation.
